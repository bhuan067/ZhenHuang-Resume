        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychologist</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">In high school, I held officer positions for all four years in Key Club. During my freshman year, I was our home club’s secretary and for the second and third year, I was my club’s division secretary. In my senior year, I was our home club’s vice president. As a division secretary, I oversaw nine other schools from my division and worked closely with the secretaries of that school. I trained them on how to use Microsoft Excel in order to complete our monthly report forms. In addition, I was involved in many service events as I was responsible to take role of the member attendance. Other than taking attendance, training home club secretaries, attending board meetings, helping other officers with their responsibilities, and making presentations to present them at division meetings, I have built strong relationships with members as well as cabinet members from other schools. This contributed to my success in member retention of a 10% increase for all four years. I was very dedicated to Key Club and spent most of my time doing community service; however, after I graduated, I got my first job at an elementary school in the Alhambra Unified School District. As an after-school program leader, I was in charge of making daily lesson plans, having fun enrichment activities every day, connecting with the students, and creating a safe place for students to express themselves freely while still being mindful of other people. I aspire to become a child psychologist; therefore, working in an after-school program with first-graders to eighth-graders, I am able to see how each age group develops and behaves. Our program emphasizes on practicing PBIS, which is Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports. Because we are after-school program leaders, most of the time our class enrichment sessions take place in other teacher’s classrooms. When we are in the classrooms, all leaders are responsible for enforcing classroom rules and respecting the space that is graciously given to us. This meant implementing PBIS when reasoning with students who are not respecting the space as they should be. PBIS values praising the students for the positive behavior they show and with inappropriate behaviors, we have to reason with them through gentle teachings without making them feel bad. One of my proudest moments while working with older students is getting through the so-called “troublemakers.” When I first started working with them, I instantly connected with the students as I was the only one who was still a “teen” whereas my other colleagues were graduate students, mothers, fathers, and grandmas. Because I was the closest in age, the kids viewed me as an older sister rather than an authoritative figure. I was aware of this and although this helped students open up to me and trust me,  I made sure I was still respected and that they still listened to my classroom rules. With a good balance between being an easygoing and unintimidating program leader but still being strict with completing the planned lessons, I was able to have a good experience working at a school.
